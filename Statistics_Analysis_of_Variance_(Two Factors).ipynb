    "#### Progress Check *18.1 A college dietitian wishes to determine whether students prefer a particular pizza topping (either plain, vegetarian, salami, or everything) and one type of crust (either thick or thin). A total of 160 volunteers are randomly assigned to one of the eight cells in this two-factor experiment. After eating their assigned pizza, the 20 subjects in each cell rate their preference on a scale ranging from 0 (inedible) to 10 (the best). The results, in the form of means for cells, rows, and columns, are as follows:\n",
