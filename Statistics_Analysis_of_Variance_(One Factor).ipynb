    "\n",
    "$F=\\dfrac{random~error + treatment~effect}{random~error}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the null hypothesis is false, the presence of a treatment effect tends to cause a chain reaction: The observed differences between group means tend to be large, as does the variability between groups. Accordingly, the numerator term tends to exceed the denominator term, producing an F whose value is larger than 1. When the null hypothesis is false because of a large treatment effect, there is an even more pronounced chain reaction, beginning with very large observed differences between group means and ending with an F whose value tends to be considerably larger than 1.\n",

This term contributes to the numerator of the $F$ ratio.

Essentially, it requires that we calculate the sum of squares, $SS$, within each group and then add these terms across all groups—in a procedure similar to that used with the two $SS$ terms in the numerator of Formula 14.2 (page 254) for the polled variance estimate, $s^2_p$. Since $SS_{within}$ always reflects only the pooled variability among subjects treated similarly, it can be referred to, more generally, as the sum of squares for random error and symbolized as $SS_{error}$.\n",
