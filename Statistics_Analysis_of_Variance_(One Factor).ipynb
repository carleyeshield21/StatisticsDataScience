    "An F test of the null hypothesis is based on the notion that if the null hypothesis is true, both the numerator and the denominator of the F ratio would tend to be about the same, but if the null hypothesis is false, the numerator would tend to be larger than the denominator.\n",

    "#### If Null Hypothesis Is True\n",
    "\n",
    "$F=\\dfrac{random~error}{random~error}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for chance, estimates in both the numerator and the denominator are similar, and generally, F varies about a value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If Null Hypothesis Is False\n",
    "\n",
    "$F=\\dfrac{random~error + treatment~effect}{random~error}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the null hypothesis is false, the presence of a treatment effect tends to cause a chain reaction: The observed differences between group means tend to be large, as does the variability between groups. Accordingly, the numerator term tends to exceed the denominator term, producing an F whose value is larger than 1. When the null hypothesis is false because of a large treatment effect, there is an even more pronounced chain reaction, beginning with very large observed differences between group means and ending with an F whose value tends to be considerably larger than 1.\n",

    "where $n$ represents the number of scores in each group, $\\overline{X}_{group}$ is the mean for each group, and $\\overline{X}_{grand}$ is the overall mean for all groups. This term contributes to the numerator of the $F$ ratio. The sample size for each group, $n$, in the expression for $SS_{between}$ reflects the fact that the deviation $\\overline{X}_{group}-\\overline{X}_{grand}$ is the same for every score, $n$, in that group."
