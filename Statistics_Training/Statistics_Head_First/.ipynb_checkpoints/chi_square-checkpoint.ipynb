Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association (April 11, 1990), Phillips and Smith report that among a total of 103 elderly California women of Chinese descent who died of natural causes within one week of the Harvest Moon Festival, only 33 died the week before, while 70 died the week after.\n",

    "#### From Witte p.401 19.12 In Chapter 1, Table 1.1 lists the weights of 53 male statistics students. Although students were asked to report their weights to the nearest pound, inspection of Table 1.1 reveals that a disproportionately large number (27) reported weights ending in either a 0 or a 5. This suggests that many students probably reported their weights rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 pounds rather than to the nearest pound. Using the .05 level of significance, test the null hypothesis that in the underlying population, weights are rounded to the nearest pound. (Hint: If the null hypothesis is true, only two-tenths of all weights should end in either a 0 or a 5, and the remaining eight-tenths of all weights should end in a 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Therefore, the situation requires a one-variable test with only two categories, and df = 1.)"
