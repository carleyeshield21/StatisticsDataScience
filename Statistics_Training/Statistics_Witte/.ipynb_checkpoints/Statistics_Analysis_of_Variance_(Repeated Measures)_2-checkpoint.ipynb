    "#### Progress Check *17.2 A school psychologist tests the effects of environmental noises on the reading comprehension scores of high school students who rotate, with the customary controls, through three different conditions: silence, white noise, and rock music.

    "(a) Since the null hypothesis was rejected in Question 17.2, use Tukey’s HSD test to identify which pairs of population means differ significantly at the .05 level, given that the means for silence, white noise, and rock equal 7.17, 5.00, and 2.33, respectively.\n",

    "(b) Use Cohen’s d to estimate the effect size for any statistically significant pairs of observed means.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Interpret the results. The partial eta-squared, $\\eta^2_p$, equals .64, a large effect. Mean reading comprehension is significantly higher when silence is compared with rock, with a standardized effect size. d, equivalent to almost two and one-half standard deviations.
