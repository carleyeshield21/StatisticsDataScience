    "Because the research hypothesis is identified with the alternative hypothesis, the decision to reject the null hypothesis, should it be made, will provide strong support for the research hypothesis, while the decision to retain the null hypothesis, should it be made, will provide, at most, weak support for the null hypothesis. As mentioned, the decision to reject the null hypothesis is stronger than the decision to retain it. Logically, a statement such as âAll cows have four legsâ can never be proven in spite of a steady stream of positive instances. It only takes one negative instanceâone cow with three legsâto disprove the statement. By the same token, one positive instance (common outcome) doesnât prove the null hypothesis, but one negative instance (rare outcome) disproves the null hypothesis. (Strictly speaking, however, since a rare outcome implies that the null hypothesis is probably but not definitely false, remember that there always is a very small possibility that the rare outcome reflects a true null hypothesis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, therefore, it makes sense to identify the research hypothesis with the alternative hypothesis. If, as hoped, the data favor the research hypothesis, the test will generate strong support for your hunch: Itâs probably true. If the data do not favor the research hypothesis, the hypothesis test will generate, at most, weak support for the null hypothesis: It could be true. Weak support for the null hypothesis is of little consequence, as this hypothesisâthat nothing special is happening in the populationâusually serves only as a convenient testing device."
