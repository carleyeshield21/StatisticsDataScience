    "Federal law might eventually specify that new automobiles must average, for example, 45 miles per gallon (mpg) of gasoline. Because it’s impossible to test all new cars, compliance tests would be based on random samples from the entire production of each car model. If a hypothesis test indicates substandard performance, the manufacturer would be penalized, we’ll assume, $200 per car for the entire production. In these tests, the null hypothesis states that, with respect to the mandated mean of 45 mpg, nothing special is happening in the population for some car model—that is, there is no substandard performance and the population mean equals or exceeds 45 mpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the manufacturer’s perspective, a type I error (a stiff penalty, even though the car complies with the standard) is very serious. Accordingly, to control the type I error, let’s use the .01 instead of the customary .05 level of significance. From the federal regulator’s perspective, a type II error (not penalizing the manufacturer even though the car fails to comply with the standard) also is serious. In practice, a sample size should be selected, as described in Section 11.11, to control the type II error, that is, to ensure a reasonable detection rate for the smallest decline (judged to be important) of the true population mean below the mandated 45 mpg. To simplify computations in the present example, however, the projected one-tailed test is based on data from a very small sample of only six randomly selected cars.\n",

    "Whether testing hypotheses or constructing confidence intervals for population means,$use~t~rather~than~z~whenever,~as~almost~always~is~the~case,~the~population~standard~deviation~is~unknown.$ Strictly speaking, when using t, you must assume that the underlying population is normally distributed. Even if this normality assumption is violated, t retains much of its accuracy as long as the sample size isn’t too small. If a very small sample (less than about 10) is being used and you believe that the sample originates from a non-normal population—possibly because of a pronounced positive or negative skew among the observations in the sample—it would be wise to increase the size of the sample before testing a hypothesis or constructing a confidence interval."
