(a) Sketch a normal curve and shade in the target area(s) described by each of the following
statements:
(i) more than 570
(ii) less than 515
(iii) between 520 and 540
(iv) between 470 and 520
(v) more than 50 points above the mean
(vi) more than 100 points either above or below the mean
(vii) within 50 points either above or below the mean</RLLNL>

z' = desired mean + z(desired sd)
a. raw score = 24; mean = 20; sd = 5

desired mean = 50; desired sd = 10
z = (24-20)/5 = 0.8
z' = 50 + (0.8*10) = 58

desired mean = 100; desired sd = 15
z' = 100 + (0.8*15) = 112

desired mean = 500; desired sd = 100
z' = 500 + (0.8*100) = 580
