    "##### 8.18 In Against All Odds, the TV series on statistics (available at http://www.learner.org/ resources/series65.html), statistician Bruce Hoadley discusses the catastrophic failure of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986. Hoadley estimates that there was a failure probability of .02 for each of the six O-rings (designed to prevent the escape of potentially explosive burning gases from the joints of the segmented rocket boosters).\n",

    "(b) Given that the six O-rings function independently of each other, what was the probability that all six O-rings would succeed, that is, perform as designed? In other words, what was the success probability of the first O-ring and the second O-ring and the third O-ring, and so forth?\n",

    "answer: (0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98 * 0.98) = 0.8858\n",

    "\n",
    "(d) Given the abysmal failure rate revealed by your answer to the previous question, why, you might wonder, was this space mission even attempted? According to Hoadley, missile engineers thought that a secondary set of O-rings would function independently of the primary set of O-rings. If true and if the failure probability of each of the secondary O-rings was the same as that for each primary O-ring (.02), what would be the probability that both the primary and secondary O-rings would fail at any one joint?

    "(e) In fact, under conditions of low temperature, as on the morning of the Challenger catastrophe, both primary and secondary O-rings lost their flexibility, and whenever the primary O-ring failed, its associated secondary O-ring also failed. Under these conditions, what would be the conditional probability of a secondary O-ring failure, given the failure of its associated primary O-ring?
