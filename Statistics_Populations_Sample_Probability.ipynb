    "##### Progress Check * 8.8 Among 100 couples who had undergone marital counseling, 60 couples described their relationships as improved, and among this latter group, 45 couples had children. The remaining couples described their relationships as unimproved, and among this group, 5 couples had children. (Hint: Using a frequency analysis, begin with the 100 couples, first branch into the number of couples with improved and unimproved relationships, then under each of these numbers, branch into the number of couples with children and without children. Enter a number at each point of the diagram before proceeding.)\n",
